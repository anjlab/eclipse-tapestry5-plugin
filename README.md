### Tapestry Context View

Go to *Window* -> *Show View* -> *Other...*, filter by "Tapestry" and select "Tapestry Context".

Tapestry Context View will appear (top right on this screenshot):

  - Provides context for opened Tapestry file
  - Includes code/template files of selected page/component, as well as list of properties files and @Import'ed assets
  - Click on the file in a view to open this file
  - Simple validation implemented to highlight assets that couldn't be resolved (supports default or 'context:' binding prefixes)
